openPOWERLINK on Windows {#page_platform_windows}
========================

[TOC]

# Introduction {#sect_windows_intro}

This file contains documentation for the openPOWERLINK stack on Windows.

__NOTE:__ Because Windows does not provide realtime behavior, openPOWERLINK can
only be run with cycle times above 10ms. The achivable minimum cycle time
depends very much on the used system and cannot be guaranteed!

# Requirements {#sect_windows_require}

## POWERLINK Network {#sect_windows_plknet}

- POWERLINK network with controlled nodes (CN)
  * openPOWERLINK controlled nodes, e.g. Altera-based FPGA evaluation boards
  * B&R POWERLINK controlled nodes
  * other POWERLINK controlled nodes

## Network Controller {#sect_windows_controller}

On a Windows system openPOWERLINK uses the WinPCAP library to access the
network interface. Therefore, no specific network controller is required.
openPOWERLINK contains the WinPCAP libary. It is located in: `contrib\pcap`

- WinPcap:  <http://www.winpcap.org>

## Windows Versions {#sect_windows_winversion}

- Supported Versions: Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7

## Libraries and Tools {#sect_linux_libs}

### Compiler and Build Environment

openPOWERLINK support the following build environments:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

### CMake

For building the openPOWERLINK stack and demo applications the Open Source
cross-platform build tool CMake is used (<http://www.cmake.org>). CMake
version V2.8.4 or higher is required.

For a detailed description of CMake look at the
[cmake section](\ref sect_build_cmake).

### QT4 Development Tools

If you want to build the QT demo application the QT4 development tools must
be installed on the system (<http://qt.digia.com/>).

### openCONFIGURATOR

The tool [openCONFIGURATOR](\ref page_openconfig) is needed to generate the
network configuration for your application.

# openPOWERLINK Stack Components {#sect_windows_components}

The following section contains a description of the
[openPOWERLINK components](\ref page_components) available on a Windows system.

## Stack Libraries

The openPOWERLINK stack is divided into a user and a kernel part. On a Windows
system only a single process solution is available, in which the whole openPOWERLINK
stack is linked to the application. The WinPCAP library is used to access the
Ethernet interface.

_Libraries:_
- `stack/proj/windows/liboplkmn` (liboplkmn.lib)
- `stack/proj/windows/liboplkcn` (liboplkcn.lib)

## Demo Applications

The following demo application are provided on Windows:

* [demo_mn_console](\ref sect_components_demo_mn_console)
* [demo_cn_console](\ref sect_components_demo_cn_console)
* [demo_mn_qt](\ref sect_components_demo_mn_qt)

# Running openPOWERLINK {#sect_windows_running}

The demo applications can be directly started by double-clicking the according
.exe file in Winodws explorer.
