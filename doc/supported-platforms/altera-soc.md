openPOWERLINK on Altera Cyclone V SoC {#page_platform_altera-soc}
==================================

[TOC]

# Introduction {#sect_altera-soc_introduction}

openPOWERLINK on Altera Cyclone V SoC runs the time-critical kernel
part of the stack on a Nios II softcore processor in the programmable
logic (PL) section. The user part of the stack runs on the
ARM Cortex A9 Core 0 in the hard processor system (HPS) section.

The Ethernet interface is built with the POWERLINK-optimized controller
openMAC, which enables e.g. low SoC jitters. Additionally, a hub IP-Core
is provided enabling daisy chained networks.

The two processors communicate with each other using a shared memory interface.

# Contents {#sect_altera-soc_contents}

The following MN hardware design is available for the Altera Cyclone V SoC board:

- PCP in PL and host in ARM Cortex A9 core 0 of HPS (driver and application): \n
  `hardware/boards/altera-c5soc/mn-soc-shmem-gpio`

# How to build the binaries {#sect_altera-soc_build}

## Generating the hardware

The Altera Quartus II project for Cyclone V SoC is located in
`hardware/boards/altera-c5soc/mn-soc-shmem-gpio/quartus.`\n

Steps 1-5 can be carried out by executing `$ make all` in a
"Nios II Command Shell".

1. Open the Quartus project file `mn-soc-shmem-gpio.qpf` with Altera Quartus II.
2. Open Qsys via the menu *Tools* -> *Qsys*.
3. Open the Qsys file (`mnSocShmemGpio.qsys`) in the demo directory and press
   the button *Generate* to generate the host and PCP system.
4. Close Qsys when the generation has finished (shown as information output).
5. Start the compilation in the Quartus II window via menu *Processing* ->
   *Start Compilation*.

## Building the driver daemon

To build the driver daemon for Altera Cyclone V SoC follow the steps below:

1. Open "Nios II Command Shell".
2. Use the software design available in the openPOWERLINK subdirectory \n
   `drivers/altera-nios2/drv_daemon/build`. \n
3. Run the script *create-this-app* to create the Makefile for the driver daemon. \n
   `$ ./create-this-app --board ../../../../hardware/boards/altera-c5soc/mn-soc-shmem-gpio` \n
4. Run make to build the ELF file after changing the sources. \n
   `$ make`
5. Run following command to generate the daemon and FPGA boot files. \n
   `$ make fpgaboot`

Some additional commands to rebuild, debug and get help information.
* After Nios II Design is changed inside Qsys, rebuild the Makefile using following command. \n
   `$ ./create-this-app --rebuild --board ../../../../hardware/boards/altera-c5soc/mn-soc-shmem-gpio`
* If you want to debug the demo by enabling prints in NIOSII, use the `--debug` option. \n
   `$ ./create-this-app --debug --board ../../../../hardware/boards/altera-c5soc/mn-soc-shmem-gpio`
* The script's help message can be printed with `--help`. \n
   `$ ./create-this-app --help`

## Building the embedded MN demo application

To build the embedded MN demo application for Altera Cyclone V SoC refer
to the [generic build instructions](\ref page_build) for using CMake and execute these steps:

* [Build hardware libraries and preloader] (\ref sect_build_hardware_build_altera_arm)
* [Build stack libraries] (\ref sect_build_stack_build_c5socarm-altera)
* [Build your application (or a delivered demo application)](\ref sect_build_demos_build_altera_arm)

# How to run the demo {#sect_altera-soc_run}

The MN embedded demo can be started on the Altera Cyclone V SoC board using the SD card boot mode.
Follow the steps below to start the MN demo on the board:

1. Open an "SoC command shell".
2. Prepare an SD card using the following commands after connecting it:\n
   - `cd <openPOWERLINK_directory>\bin\generic\alterac5arm\altera-c5soc\mn-soc-shmem-gpio`
   - `dd if=<Altera_installation_dir>/embedded/embeddedsw/socfpga/prebuilt_images/sd_card_linux_boot_image.img
      of=/dev/<sd_card_drive> bs=1M`
   - `alt-boot-disk-util.exe -p preloader-mkpimage.bin -a write -d <sd_card_path>`
3. Copy the `BOOT.bin` and `fpga.rbf` from `<openPOWERLINK_directory>\bin\generic\alterac5arm\altera-c5soc\mn-soc-shmem-gpio`
   to the SD card.
4. Boot the Altera Cylcone V SoC from the prepared SD card.
5. Enjoy running the POWERLINK network.

# Troubleshooting {#sect_altera-soc_trouble}

- Frame CRC error for the transmitted frames from PHY

  The PHYs of Altera Cyclone V SoC revision D development board are configured to
  operate in synchronous mode, by boot strapping resistors. For POWERLINK operation,
  the PHYs need to be configured in asynchronous mode.

  To enable asynchronous operation the boot strapping resistor `R522` needs to be removed.
  For more information refer to [Rocket boards website](http://rocketboards.org/foswiki/view/Documentation/CVSoCDevelopmentBoardRevisionInfo)

  In order to avoid the modifications on the development board, the hardware design
  is updated to choose PHY transmission modes based on the revision of the development board.
  The board revision can be specified using the __gBoardRev__ parameter in the toplevel.vhd file.
  By default the revision is set to __"D"__ and is tested on the same.
