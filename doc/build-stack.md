Building openPOWERLINK Stack Libraries {#page_build_stack}
======================================

[TOC]

# Building Stack Libraries{#sect_build_stack_build}

The openPOWERLINK stack itself is implemented via stack libraries. A stack
library can either contain the whole stack (_complete library_), the user part
(_application library_) or the kernel part (_driver library_).

__NOTE:__ In order to be able to build an application, both, the Debug and the Release
library versions must be created.

## Linux {#sect_build_stack_build_linux}

Follow the steps below to build the stack on a Linux system. On Linux, CMake
generates Makefiles by default.

* Creating debug libraries

      > cd openPOWERLINK/stack/build/linux
      > cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
      > make
      > make install

* Creating release libraries

      > cd openPOWERLINK/stack/build/linux
      > cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
      > make
      > make install

The default library installation path is: `<openPOWERLINK_DIR>/lib/linux/<ARCH>`


## Windows {#sect_build_stack_build_windows}

Follow the steps below to build the stack on a Windows system using NMake.
Open a Visual Studio command line and enter the following commands:

* Creating debug libraries

      > cd <openPOWERLINK_directory>\stack\build\windows
      > cmake -G"NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\..
      > nmake
      > nmake install

* Creating release libraries

      > cd <openPOWERLINK_directory>\stack\build\windows
      > cmake -G"NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\..
      > nmake
      > nmake install

The default library installation path is: `<openPOWERLINK_DIR>\lib\windows\<ARCH>`

__NOTE:__ You can also generate a Visual Studio Solution and compile the
libraries in Visual Studio. Please refer to the CMAKE documentation for
generating Visual Studio solution files.

## Microblaze {#sect_build_stack_build_microblaze}

Follow the steps below to build the stack library on your host platform:
* Open a shell where the Xilinx ISE 14.7 Toolchain is configured.
  - On a Windows host platform open the `ISE Design Suite [64,32] Bit Command
    Prompt`.
  - On a Linux host platform execute the script `<ISE_ROOT_DIR>/settings[32,64].sh>`
    to configure your current shell.

* Creating debug libraries

      > cd <openPOWERLINK_directory>\stack\build\xilinx-microblaze
      > cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../cmake/toolchain-xilinx-microblaze-gnu.cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
      > make all
      > make install

* Creating release libraries

      > cd <openPOWERLINK_directory>\stack\build\xilinx-microblaze
      > cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../cmake/toolchain-xilinx-microblaze-gnu.cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
      > make all
      > make install

The default library installation path is:
`<openPOWERLINK_DIR>/stack/lib/generic/microblaze/<BOARD_NAME>/<DEMO_NAME>`

## Xilinx ARM {#sect_build_stack_build_arm-xilinx}

Follow the steps below to build the stack library on your host platform:
* Open a shell where the Xilinx ISE 14.7 Toolchain is configured.
  - On a Windows host platform open the `ISE Design Suite [64,32] Bit Command
    Prompt`.
  - On a Linux host platform execute the script `<ISE_ROOT_DIR>/settings[32,64].sh>`
    to configure your current shell.

* Creating debug libraries

      > cd <openPOWERLINK_directory>\stack\build\xilinx-arm
      > cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../cmake/toolchain-xilinx-arm-gnu.cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
      > make all
      > make install

* Creating release libraries

      > cd <openPOWERLINK_directory>\stack\build\xilinx-arm
      > cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../cmake/toolchain-xilinx-arm-gnu.cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
      > make all
      > make install

The default library installation path is:
`<openPOWERLINK_DIR>/stack/lib/generic/arm/<BOARD_NAME>/<DEMO_NAME>`

# Configuration Options {#sect_build_stack_options}

If you would like to change the configuration options you have to provide
the configuration options on the command line (-DCFG_XXX=XXX) or
[call CMake in an interactive mode](\ref sect_build_cmake_interactive).

## Generic Configuration Options

- **CFG_DEBUG_LVL**

  Debug level to be used for openPOWERLINK debugging functions.

- **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX**

  Specifies the installation directory where your files will be installed.

  Default directory is: `<openPOWERLINK_DIR>/lib/${SYSTEM_DIR_NAME}/${CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR}`

- **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE**

  Specifies your build type.
  Valid build types are: _Debug_, _Release_

  If the build type _Debug_ is specified, the code is compiled with debugging
  options.
