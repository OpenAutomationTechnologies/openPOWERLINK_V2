- Xilinx Zynq MN:
    - When following the steps in [xapp1093](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp1093-amp-bare-metal-microblaze.pdf)
      to run Microblaze without FSBL XMD-connect fails to stop/reset Microblaze.
      Usually this error can be ignored, debugging Microblaze is possible although.
      Otherwise, debugging the design with using the FSBL works.

    - The address map to HP0 AXI slave port of PS is not forwarded to system.xml
      by XPS automatically. Therefore, the `system.xml` in
      `hardware/boards/xilinx-z702/mn-dual-shmem-gpio/sdk` is used instead.
      If any changes are done in XPS (e.g. add some IP-Core, change addresses or
      add Chip Scope instance), the `system.xml` in `hardware/boards/xilinx-z702/mn-dual-shmem-gpio/sdk`
      must be revised accordingly.

### Removals:
- Remove outdated VxWorks documentation

## V2.0.0 {#sect_revision_v2_0_0}

This is the final release of openPOWERLINK V2.0.0.

### Changes:

- Selection of openCONFIGURATOR project for MN demos in CMake configuration
- Added error signaling initialization on MN
- Backporting of features from V1.08.3 and V1.08.4
  - MN support for extended NMT commands
  - Notification about PDO change events
  - Ethernet driver (edrv) for Intel I210 added
  - Implemented time triggered sending together with I210 driver
- Code clean-up
- Documentation clean-up
- Several bugfixes

### Known Issues:

- Altera FPGA MN:
  - After an up and running CN is reconnected to the network the FPGA MN is not able
    bringing the node to operational again.

    __Solution__:
      - Restart the host processor (e.g. in demo_mn_embedded `make download-elf`).
      - If the error resists, reprogram FPGA also (in drv_daemon `make download-all`).

  - In case of short cycle times the FPGA MN enters off state due to full queues.

    __Possible errors__: kErrorNoResource, kErrorEventPostError and kErrorDllAsyncTxBufferFull

    __Solution__:
    - Restart the host processor (e.g. in demo_mn_embedded `make download-elf`).
    - If the error resists, reprogram FPGA also (in drv_daemon `make download-all`).
    - Hold the MN in PreOp_1 until all nodes are configured or
    - Start up the network stepwise (connect first 2 CNs, then another
      2 CNs and so on...)

## V2.0.0-b1 {#sect_revision_v2_0_0_b1}

This is the first beta version of the openPOWERLINK release 2.0.0.

- The file system is slightly restructured and cleaned up
- Source Code is further refactored and cleaned up
- Header files are clearly separated into internal and external files
- The build system is separated for the stack, the hardware (fpga), the
  drivers and the demo applications
- Stack is compiled as static/dynamic libraries which will be linekd by all
  applications
- Support for CMake cross-compilation is added
- Xilinx build uses CMake now
- FPGA IP cores are updated
- Documentation is improved
- Stack configuration is simplified

## V2.0.0 pre1 {#sect_revision_v2_0_0_pre1}

This is an early preview of the upcoming openPOWERLINK release 2.0.0.
The new code base works fairly stable on Linux, Windows and FPGA platforms.
A lot of modules are refactored and cleaned-up but there are still several
files which need to be reformated and renamed. The release should give
a good overview on the new architecture and directory structure and can be
used for testing. It is not advised to use it in productive environments!
